## Tests

The files ".sh" are bash shell scripts.
The files ".log" are output of the script files.

**00_test_same_directory**

Overwrite Version 1.0 2019-10-04 creates the file in a subdirectory.
So only one directory entry in the given path was overwritten.

Overwrite Version 1.3.1 2019-10-30 uses short directory names too
overwrite entries. If entries with long names should be overwritten
2 or more entries are needed to overwrite one.
(FAT file system)

The documentation of overwrite version 1.4.1 2019-11-03 advices
to set a higher number in -dirs parameter to overwrite all
directory entries.

**01_test_short_names**

Overwrite ver1.2-2019-10-28 create files with long names.
So the directory entry with short name inside the directory
list was not overwritten.
(FAT file system)

Overwrite Version 1.3.1 2019-10-30 uses short directory names too
overwrite entries.

**02_test_overflow**

Overwrite version 1.3.1 2019-10-30 uses strcpy and strcat without
checking the string length. So a very long path name argument
causes a buffer overflow.

Overwrite version 1.4.1 2019-11-03 handles also very long path names.
